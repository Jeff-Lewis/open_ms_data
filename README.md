# Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Data

The data in this repository is from the Laboratory of Imaging Technologies (http://lit.fe.uni-lj.si/tools.php?lang=eng).

## Cross-sectional data

The cross-sectional data is from the "3D MR image database of Multiple Sclerosis patients with white matter lesion segmentations" section of the website.

## Longitudinal data

The cross-sectional data is from the "Longitudinal MR image database of Multiple Sclerosis patients with white matter lesion change segmentation" section of the website.  

This archive contains longitudinal Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with corresponding
ground truth segmentations of white matter lesion changes. Each patient has been imaged twice on two separate occasions. The
images are grouped intro folders for each of the patients.
